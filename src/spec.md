# Heartfelt Confession Web App

## Overview
A minimal web application that displays a heartfelt message confessing feelings to "Shuchi" with interactive "Yes" and "No" buttons.

## Core Features

### Main Interface
- Display the confession message: "Hey Shuchi.. I know it is a very sudden confession.. but I just wanna tell you that.. I have loved you since 6th.. it's been 4 years.. I never had the courage to say it face to face.. but just wanna ask that.. will you like to know me.. yes or no?"
- Present two buttons: "Yes" and "No"
- Use clean, minimal design with subtle tones and simple fonts

### Interactive Behavior
- **"No" Button**: When clicked, displays a random sweet and gentle pleading message each time (e.g., "Please say yes 🥺", "pretty please 💛", "You sure? I promise I'll make you smile 😊") and optionally moves to a random position on the screen with smooth animation, making it playful to interact with
- **Unlimited Interactions**: Both buttons remain fully usable at all times, allowing unlimited attempts
- **"Yes" Button**: Can be pressed unlimited times until clicked for the first time. Upon first "Yes" click, shows an animated thank-you message: "Thankkk youuuu thankkkk youuu veryyyy muchhh 💛💛💛"

### Success Animation

  - Soft fade-in text effect
  - Floating heart effects rising subtly on screen
